# AI/ML Project with PyTorch or Ollama Open Source LLM

# AI-Powered Document Summarization Tool

Description: A tool that takes a document (PDF, Word, or raw text) as input and returns a summarized version. The first iteration uses a model like Ollama and Llama2 Model. The goal here is to demonstrate understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and AI. The next iteration will use PyTorch to create our own model.

Steps:

- Data Collection: Gather datasets of long-form text (news articles, academic papers, etc.) or use pre-existing ones from sources like Kaggle.
- Model Creation:
  - Ollama's Open-Source LLM: Leverage Ollama's API for prompt-based summarization, which saves us training a model yourself.
  - PyTorch: Train a sequence-to-sequence model or use pre-trained transformer models (like BERT, T5, or GPT) to summarize text.
- Backend Implementation: Create an API to handle the processing of input text, interacting with the model for summarization.
- Frontend: Build a simple web interface to upload documents and view summaries.
- Skills Highlighted:
  - PyTorch
  - NLP/Transformer models
  - Working with Open Source LLMs like Ollama
  - API design for text processing
  - Container orchestration with docker-compose
  - Deployment

Tech Stack:

- Python (PyTorch or Ollama LLM)
- Flask/FastAPI (for API)
- Docker and docker-compose
- Frontend: React or basic HTML5/JS (optional)
