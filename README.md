# AI/ML Project with PyTorch or Ollama Open Source LLM

# AI-Powered Document Summarization Tool

Description: Create a tool that takes a document (PDF, Word, or raw text) as input and returns a summarized version. You can either build this with a custom model using PyTorch or utilize an open-source language model like Ollama (which focuses on large language models). The goal here is to demonstrate your understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and AI.

Steps:

- Data Collection: Gather datasets of long-form text (news articles, academic papers, etc.) or use pre-existing ones from sources like Kaggle.
- Model Creation:
  - If using PyTorch: Train a sequence-to-sequence model or use pre-trained transformer models (like BERT, T5, or GPT) to summarize text.
  - If using Ollama's Open-Source LLM: You can leverage Ollama's API for prompt-based summarization, which would save you from training a model yourself.
- Backend Implementation: Create an API to handle the processing of input text, interacting with the model for summarization.
- Frontend (Optional): If you want to make the project interactive, you can build a simple web interface to upload documents and view summaries.
- Skills Highlighted:
  - PyTorch (if using)
  - NLP/Transformer models
  - Working with Open Source LLMs like Ollama
  - API design for text processing
  - Deployment (if you deploy this as a web app)

Tech Stack:

- Python (PyTorch or Ollama LLM)
- Flask/FastAPI (for API)
- Frontend: React or basic HTML5/JS (optional)
